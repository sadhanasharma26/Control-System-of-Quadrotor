# Applications
* Aerial photography and videography: Whether for private or professional use, quadrotors are frequently utilised to take pictures and videos from the air. With typical cameras, these perspectives and angles could be challenging or impossible to accomplish.
* Search and rescue: Quadrotors offer a bird's-eye view of the terrain and can quickly cover enormous regions.
* Surveillance and reconnaissance: Quadrotors are employed by security, military, and law enforcement agencies for surveillance and reconnaissance tasks. They may have sensors, cameras, and other equipment to acquire data and intelligence from the air.
